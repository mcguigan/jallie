## Description

Java Classfile assembler/disassembler and low-level interactive editor. Allows
viewing and manipulation of Java class data both manually and via scripts. Load
in a class file, make changes, and then save the result.


## Installation

Technically, not needed. Jallie is packaged as a standalone script which uses
/bin/sh and python and should execute fine in place.  You may need to add
the execute flag to the script via "chmod +x bin/jallie".

Either place the jallie executable somewhere on your path, or just run it with
a full pathname.
